## Introduction to Visual Studio Code

### What is Visual Studio Code?
Visual Studio code is an application that is used to make code easier to work with and develop, no matter the language used.

### Key Features of VSCode
The key features of VSCode include the ability to download extensions onto VSCode this allows users to work with multiple coding languages easily by just using the correct file types and syntax for those coding languages. VSCode also has a debugger for users to use that will help the user find any flaws in their code to eliminate bugs that will show up when the code is run. Version control allows you to use Git to initialize new repositories, create new branches, commit changes, merge branches, switch branches, and most other things that you do with Git all inside of Visual Studio Code. VSCodes IntelliSense does all of the hard syntax work when working with code for you reducing most of the errors made when creating code and making it so the user can focus more of their time on writing the actual code for their program rather than working with the syntax of the language.

## Exploring VSCode

### Customizing the Workspace
In VSCode you can customize how it looks by changing the settings of your workspace to better suit how you enjoy looking at your code, You can also pull up multiple files of code at the same time and work on them simultaneously, This allows you to move from one file to the next seamlessly and effortlessly without having to go through the hassle of constantly opening and closing files to start coding on your new files.

### Extensions and Their Impact
One of the extensions I use is called Live View. Live view allows you to preview your webpages when working with webpages on a local server in VSCode removing the hassle of having to open .html files to view them on your browser. I also use Gitlens which allows me to view and seamlessly navigate through my git repositories and branches. I also use Live server which launches a local server that shows me how my code is running inside of VSCode.


## Efficiency in Development

### Code Editing and Navigation
Using VSCode coding software has made my workflow much faster without having to deal with all of the hassles that I would have to face if I was not using VSCode. VSCode made my workflow much quicker and much more efficient.

### Debugging with VSCode
The debug console allows the user to view and interact with the code that is running inside of the debugger. During the debug session you can interact with the call stack, the breakpoints, the variables, and the watch variables.


## Conclusion

### Reflecting on the Importance of a Development Environment
The significance of understanding and utilizing a development environment like VSCode is development environments such as it allows the user using the software to be more efficient in their workflow and allows the user to switch between multiple coding languages and work in multiple coding environments at the same time.
